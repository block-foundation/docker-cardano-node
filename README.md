**Welcome to the Block Foundation's Cardano Node Docker Image Repository!**

## Introduction

Our repository is designed with the purpose of providing a Docker image that is built to run a Cardano Node. As you may know, a node in the Cardano network serves as an integral part of the network's infrastructure, maintaining an updated copy of the entire Cardano blockchain, validating transactions, blocks and propelling them across the network. Docker, on the other hand, is a well-known platform that streamlines the deployment, scaling, and operation of applications.

This Docker image, specifically tailored for the Cardano Node, is designed to maximize usability, robustness, and security. It comes equipped with a pre-set environment that eradicates the need for manual setup, making it an invaluable tool for developers and enthusiasts who want to delve into the Cardano network or contribute to the network's expansion by running their own node.

Within this repository, you will find comprehensive instructions on how to deploy and use the Docker image, along with the source code for the image itself. We encourage our community to leverage this Docker image, share their experiences and contribute to its ongoing refinement and development.

## System Requirements

- CPU: ARM64 processor min 2 cores at 2GHz or faster.
- Memory: 16GB of RAM.
- Storage: 50 GB.
- Broadband: 10 Mbps +
