## Introduction

Hello and welcome to the Block Foundation's Cardano Node Docker Image Repository! This repository is a crucial part of our mission to drive architectural innovation and address housing disparities via blockchain technology.

Our repository is designed with the purpose of providing a Docker image that is built to run a Cardano Node. As you may know, a node in the Cardano network serves as an integral part of the network's infrastructure, maintaining an updated copy of the entire Cardano blockchain, validating transactions, blocks and propelling them across the network. Docker, on the other hand, is a well-known platform that streamlines the deployment, scaling, and operation of applications.

This Docker image, specifically tailored for the Cardano Node, is designed to maximize usability, robustness, and security. It comes equipped with a pre-set environment that eradicates the need for manual setup, making it an invaluable tool for developers and enthusiasts who want to delve into the Cardano network or contribute to the network's expansion by running their own node.

Within this repository, you will find comprehensive instructions on how to deploy and use the Docker image, along with the source code for the image itself. We encourage our community to leverage this Docker image, share their experiences and contribute to its ongoing refinement and development.

This initiative is a testament to our unwavering commitment to transparency, collaborative development, and democratization of technology. We're thrilled to share this resource with you and anticipate seeing how it facilitates your involvement within the blockchain sphere.

Thank you for being a part of the Block Foundation community. Your participation propels our journey towards transforming the architectural and real estate sectors through the adoption of blockchain technology. Together, we can shape a future that is more sustainable, inclusive, and progressively oriented.

## Development

### Authors

This is an open-source project by the **[Block Foundation](https://www.blockfoundation.io "Block Foundation website")**.

The Block Foundation mission is enabling architects to take back initiative and contribute in solving the mismatch in housing through blockchain technology. Therefore the Block Foundation seeks to unschackle the traditional constraints and construct middle ground between rent and the rigidity of traditional mortgages.
